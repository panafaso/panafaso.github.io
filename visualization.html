    <h1 class="special-title">Choropleth map</h1>
        <p>This class of maps is so-called choropleth maps, with color gradations representing statistical values across geographic sections. It illustrates the percentage of households with internet access at home in 2023 of European regions. 
            Dark blue displays the regions with the highest access rates and shifts through various shades of blue toward yellow showing regions with the lowest access rate, thereby representing regional disparities effectively. 
            Eurostat, as well as any other EU institutions have widely used this kind of data visualization to aid the easy analysis and presentation of statistical information. 
            I selected this map because internet access is a fundamental building block in digital inclusion and socio-economic development. There is uneven connectivity in Europe: while some regions are well connected, others, especially in Southeastern Europe and some rural areas, lag behind. 
            For example, certain areas of Greece have lower internet access rates, a reflection of the persistent digital divide between urban and rural areas. Great potential exists to make a significant difference through the expansion of internet infrastructure and wider access, bringing opportunities for such activities as education, remote work, and access to basic online services. 
            Moreover, the information is very relevant, as it may give policymakers the insight to reduce digital inequality and inspire connectivity to the more deprived areas. I like this map for its clear visual representation of digital access inequalities, making the complex information easy to interpret. </p>
